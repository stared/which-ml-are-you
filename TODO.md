# TODO

## TODO

- [x] Dataset scale
- [ ] Mouseover etc
- [ ] Modularize predicted classes
- [ ] Train and validation
- [ ] More datasets (Iris)
- [ ] Compare to algorithms
- [ ] Level progression (now level selection is fine-ish)

## Recently accomplished

- [x] Data loading
- [x] Graphical false positive and negative

## Also consider

- [ ] Maybe "Confusion Matrix Metrics" is worth a post on its own
- [ ] Dropdown with https://mikerodham.github.io/vue-dropdowns/
- [ ] Algorithms inside JS
- [ ] Also a variant with ROC and AP curves
