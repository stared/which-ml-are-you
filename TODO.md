# TODO

## TODO

* Dataset scale
* Mouseover etc
* Modularize predicted classes
* Train and validation
* More datasets (Iris)
* Compare to algorithms
* Level progression (now level selection is fine-ish)

## Recently accomplished

* Data loading
* graphical false positive and negative

## Also consider

* Maybe "Confusion Matrix Metrics" is worth a post on its own
* dropdown with https://mikerodham.github.io/vue-dropdowns/
* algorithms inside JS
* also a variant with
* ROC and AP curves
